INSTRUCTIONS

In this assignment you will define a class and perform the requested tasks. Please include both the Python code and the corresponding outputs in either a Python script or a Jupyter notebook, and then submit your work on Canvas.

TOTAL POINTS: 10

1. Read in the market data from apple_data.csv
2. (5 PTS) Define a class with these requirements:
  -class name: Stock
  -contains attributes:
     - ticker
     - prices
     - sector
  -contains methods:
     - print_sector()

     - get_row_count()
       count the number of rows in the price dataframe      
       set an attribute "price_records" equal to this count
 
  -contains __init__(ticker, prices, sector) to build objects 

3. (1 PT) Using your class, create a stock with: 
          ticker: 'AAPL', sector:'technology', prices: the imported price data
          Use the dot operator to print the stock's ticker.
             
4. (1 PT) Use the print_sector() method to print the sector

5. (2 PTS) Use the get_row_count() method to compute the number of price records and set price_records.
           Use the dot operator to access the stock's price_records, printing the result.

6. (1 PT) Compute the daily percent changes in the stock prices, 
           saving the results into the dataframe, specificallly: aapl.prices['returns'].
           Print out the first five rows of the aapl.prices dataframe. 
           
           Note that in this instance, we've referred to the stock object as 'aapl,' 
           but feel free to name it whatever you prefer.
